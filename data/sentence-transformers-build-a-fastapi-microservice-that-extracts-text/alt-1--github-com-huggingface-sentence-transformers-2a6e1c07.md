# Sentence Transformers: Embeddings, Retrieval, and Reranking

This framework provides an easy method to compute embeddings for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models. It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models ( [quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer) ), to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models ( [quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder) ), to generate sparse embeddings using Sparse Encoder models ( [quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#sparse-encoder) ) or to compute token-level embeddings for ColBERT-style late-interaction retrieval using Multi-Vector Encoder models ( [quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#multi-vector-encoder) ). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including [semantic search](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html) , [semantic textual similarity](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html) , and [paraphrase mining](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html) .

A wide selection of over [15,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers) are available for immediate use on 🤗 Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the [Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) . Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own [embedding models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html) , [reranker models](https://sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html) , [sparse encoder models](https://sbert.net/docs/sparse_encoder/training_overview.html) or [multi-vector encoder models](https://sbert.net/docs/multi_vector_encoder/training_overview.html) using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.

For the **full documentation** , see  **[www.SBERT.net](https://www.sbert.net)**  .

## Installation

We recommend **Python 3.10+** ,  **[PyTorch 2.2+](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)**  , and  **[transformers v5.0+](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)**  .

```
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

See [Installation](https://www.sbert.net/docs/installation.html) in the docs for uv, conda, source, and editable installs, CUDA setup, and extras ( `[image]` , `[audio]` , `[video]` , `[train]` , `[onnx]` , `[openvino]` , `[dev]` ).

## Getting Started

See [Quickstart](https://www.sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html) in our documentation.

### Embedding Models

First download a pretrained embedding a.k.a. Sentence Transformer model.

```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then provide some texts to the model.

```
sentences =
 [
    "The weather is lovely today.",
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    "He drove to the stadium.",
]embeddings = model.encode(sentences)print(embeddings.shape)# => (3, 384)
```

And that's already it. We now have numpy arrays with the embeddings, one for each text. We can use these to compute similarities.

```
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)print(similarities)# tensor([[1.0000, 0.6660, 0.1046],
#         [0.6660, 1.0000, 0.1411],
#         [0.1046, 0.1411, 1.0000]])
```

### Reranker Models

First download a pretrained reranker a.k.a. Cross Encoder model.

```
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# 1. Load a pretrained CrossEncoder model
model = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then provide some texts to the model.

```
# The texts for which to predict similarity scores
query = "How many people live in Berlin?"
passages =
 [
    "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.",
    "Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.",
    "In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.",
]
# 2a. predict scores for pairs of texts
scores = model.predict([(query, passage) for passage in passages])print(scores)# => [8.607139 5.506266 6.352977]
```

And we're good to go. You can also use  [`model.rank`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/cross_encoder/cross_encoder.html#sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.model.CrossEncoder.rank)  to avoid having to perform the reranking manually:

```
# 2b. Rank a list of passages for a query
ranks = model.rank(query, passages, return_documents
=
True)
print("Query:", query)for rank in ranks:
    print(f"- #
{
rank['corpus_id']}

 (
{
rank['score']:.2f}
):
{
rank['text']}
")"""
Query: How many people live in Berlin?
- #0 (8.61): Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.
- #2 (6.35): In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.
- #1 (5.51): Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.
"""
```

### Sparse Encoder Models

First download a pretrained sparse embedding a.k.a. Sparse Encoder model.

```
from sentence_transformers import SparseEncoder

# 1. Load a pretrained SparseEncoder model
model = SparseEncoder("naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil")
# The sentences to encode
sentences =
 [
    "The weather is lovely today.",
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    "He drove to the stadium.",
]
# 2. Calculate sparse embeddings by calling model.encode()
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)print(embeddings.shape)# [3, 30522] - sparse representation with vocabulary size dimensions

# 3. Calculate the embedding similarities
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)print(similarities)# tensor([[   35.629,     9.154,     0.098],
#         [    9.154,    27.478,     0.019],
#         [    0.098,     0.019,    29.553]])

# 4. Check sparsity stats
stats = SparseEncoder.sparsity(embeddings)print(f"Sparsity:
{
stats['sparsity_ratio']:.2%}
")# Sparsity: 99.84%
```

### Multi-Vector Encoder Models

First download a pretrained multi-vector a.k.a. late-interaction (ColBERT-style) model.

```
from sentence_transformers import MultiVectorEncoder

# 1. Load a pretrained MultiVectorEncoder model
model = MultiVectorEncoder("lightonai/GTE-ModernColBERT-v1")
queries =
 ["What is the capital of France?"]documents =
 [
    "Paris is the capital of France.",
    "Berlin is the capital of Germany.",
]
# 2. Encode queries and documents into sequences of token-level embeddings
query_embeddings = model.encode_query(queries)document_embeddings = model.encode_document(documents)print(query_embeddings[0].shape, document_embeddings[0].shape)# (10, 128) (9, 128)  # one 128-dimensional vector per token

# 3. Score them with late interaction (MaxSim)
scores = model.similarity(query_embeddings, document_embeddings)print(scores)# tensor([[9.6037, 9.4055]])
```

## Pre-Trained Models

## Training

> **Tip:** Using an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, ...)? Install the  [`train-sentence-transformers`](/huggingface/sentence-transformers/blob/main/skills)  Hugging Face Agent Skill via `hf skills add train-sentence-transformers [--claude] [--global]` and ask your agent to fine-tune a model on your data.

This framework allows you to fine-tune your own sentence embedding methods, so that you get task-specific sentence embeddings. You have various options to choose from in order to get perfect sentence embeddings for your specific task.
