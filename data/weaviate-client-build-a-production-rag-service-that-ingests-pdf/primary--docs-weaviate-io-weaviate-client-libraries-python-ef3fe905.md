Python client (SDK)

The latest Python client is version `v4.23.0` .

[weaviate/weaviate-python-client](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client)   [Reference manual (docstrings)](https://weaviate-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This page broadly covers the Weaviate Python client ( `v4` release). For usage information not specific to the Python client, such as code examples, see the relevant pages in the [How-to manuals & Guides](/weaviate/guides) .

## Installation [​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

The Python client library is developed and tested using Python 3.8+. It is available on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/weaviate-client/) , and can be installed with:

```
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

  For installing beta versions

```
pip install --pre -U "weaviate-client==4.*"`
```

   Requirements: Weaviate version compatibility & gRPC

#### Weaviate version compatibility [​](#weaviate-version-compatibility "Direct link to Weaviate version compatibility")

The `v4` Python client requires Weaviate `v1.23.7` and later. Generally, we encourage you to use the latest version of the Python client and the Weaviate Database.

In Weaviate Cloud, clusters are compatible with the `v4` client as of 31 January, 2024. Clusters created before this date will not be compatible with the `v4` client.

#### gRPC [​](#grpc "Direct link to gRPC")

The `v4` client uses remote procedure calls (RPCs) under-the-hood. Accordingly, a port for gRPC must be open to your Weaviate server.

 docker-compose.yml example

If you are running Weaviate with Docker, you can map the default port ( `50051` ) by adding the following to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
ports:
  - 8080:8080
  - 50051:50051
```

#### Query Agent [​](#query-agent "Direct link to Query Agent")

You can install the Weaviate client library with the optional `agents` extras to use the [Query Agent](/query-agent) . Install the client library using the following command:

```
pip install -U "weaviate-client[agents]"
```

## Get started [​](#get-started "Direct link to Get started")

Prerequisites

If you haven't yet, we recommend going through the  [**Quickstart tutorial**](/weaviate/quickstart)  first to get the most out of this section.

Get started with Weaviate using this Python example. The code walks you through these key steps:

1. **[Connect to Weaviate](/weaviate/connections)**  : Establish a connection to a local (or Cloud) Weaviate instance.
2. **[Create a collection](/weaviate/manage-collections)**  : Define the data schema for a `Question` collection, using an Ollama model to vectorize the data.
3. **[Import data](/weaviate/manage-objects/import)**  : Fetch sample Jeopardy questions and use Weaviate's batch import for efficient ingestion and automatic vector embedding generation.
4. **[Search/query the database](/weaviate/search)**  : Execute a vector search to find questions semantically similar to the query `biology` .

.Vectors.text2vec\_xxx with AutoSchema

Defining a collection with `Configure.Vectors.text2vec_xxx()` with Python client library `4.16.0` - `4.16.3` will throw an error if no properties are defined and `vectorize_collection_name` is not set to `True` .

This is addressed in `4.16.4` of the Weaviate Python client. See this FAQ entry for more details: [Invalid properties error in Python client versions 4.16.0 to 4.16.3](/weaviate/more-resources/faq#q-invalid-properties-error-when-creating-a-collection-python-client-versions-4160-to-4163) .

```
import weaviate
import requests, json
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure

client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

questions = client.collections.create(
    name="Question",
    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_ollama(
        api_endpoint="http://ollama:11434",  # If using Docker you might need: http://host.docker.internal:11434
        model="nomic-embed-text",  # The model to use
    ),  # Configure the Ollama embedding model
)

resp = requests.get(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json"
)
data = json.loads(resp.text)

with questions.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for d in data:
        batch.add_object(
            {
                "answer": d["Answer"],
                "question": d["Question"],
                "category": d["Category"],
            }
        )
        if batch.number_errors > 10:
            print("Batch import stopped due to excessive errors.")
            break

failed_objects = questions.batch.failed_objects
if failed_objects:
    print(f"Number of failed imports: {len(failed_objects)}")
    print(f"First failed object: {failed_objects[0]}")

response = questions.query.near_text(query="biology", limit=2)

for obj in response.objects:
    print(json.dumps(obj.properties, indent=2))

client.close()  # Free up resources
```

For more code examples, check out the [How-to manuals & Guides](/weaviate/guides) section.

## Asynchronous usage [​](#asynchronous-usage "Direct link to Asynchronous usage")

The Python client library provides a synchronous API by default through the `WeaviateClient` class, which is covered on this page. An asynchronous API is also available through the `WeaviateAsyncClient` class (from `weaviate-client` `v4.7.0` and up). See the [async client API page](/weaviate/client-libraries/python/async) for further details.

## Releases [​](#releases "Direct link to Releases")

Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client/releases) to see the history of the Python client library releases and change logs.

#### TypeScript client change [​](#typescript-client-change "Direct link to TypeScript client change")

The [TypeScript client](https://github.com/weaviate/typescript-client) replaced the [JavaScript client](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-javascript-client) on 2023-03-17.

#### Vectorizer API changes `v4.16.0` [​](#vectorizer-api-changes-v4160 "Direct link to vectorizer-api-changes-v4160")

.Vectors.text2vec\_xxx with AutoSchema

Defining a collection with `Configure.Vectors.text2vec_xxx()` with Python client library `4.16.0` - `4.16.3` will throw an error if no properties are defined and `vectorize_collection_name` is not set to `True` .

This is addressed in `4.16.4` of the Weaviate Python client. See this FAQ entry for more details: [Invalid properties error in Python client versions 4.16.0 to 4.16.3](/weaviate/more-resources/faq#q-invalid-properties-error-when-creating-a-collection-python-client-versions-4160-to-4163) .

Starting with the Weaviate Python client `v4.16.0` , there are multiple changes to the vectorizer configuration API when creating collections:

* `.vectorizer_config` has been replaced with `.vector_config`
* `Configure.NamedVectors` has been replaced with `Configure.Vectors` and `Configure.MultiVectors`
* `Configure.NamedVectors.none` and `Configure.Vectorizer.none` have been replaced with `Configure.Vectors.self_provided` and `Configure.MultiVectors.self_provided`

#### Python client `v3` deprecation [​](#python-client-v3-deprecation "Direct link to python-client-v3-deprecation")

The Weaviate Python client `v3` has been deprecated and should no longer be used. If you need documentation for the `v3` client, see the [documentation archive](https://archive.docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/python/python_v3) . If you are migrating from the Python `v3` client to the `v4` client, see this [migration guide](https://archive.docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/python/v3_v4_migration) .

#### Beta releases [​](#beta-releases "Direct link to Beta releases")

  Migration guides - beta releases

#### Changes in `v4.4b9` [​](#changes-in-v44b9 "Direct link to changes-in-v44b9")

##### `weaviate.connect_to_x` methods [​](#weaviateconnect_to_x-methods "Direct link to weaviateconnect_to_x-methods")

The `timeout` argument in now a part of the `additional_config` argument. It takes the class `weaviate.config.AdditionalConfig` as input.

##### Queries [​](#queries "Direct link to Queries")

All optional arguments to methods in the `query` namespace now are enforced as keyword arguments.

There is now runtime logic for parsing query arguments enforcing the correct type.

##### Batch processing [​](#batch-processing "Direct link to Batch processing")

Introduction of three distinct algorithms using different batching styles under-the-hood:

* `client.batch.dynamic()`
* `client.batch.fixed_size()`
* `client.batch.rate_limit()`

`client.batch.dynamic() as batch` is a drop-in replacement for the previous `client.batch as batch` , which is now deprecated and will be removed on release.

```
with client.batch.dynamic() as batch:
  ...
```

is equivalent to:

```
with client.batch as batch:
  ...
```

`client.batch.fixed_size() as batch` is a way to configure your batching algorithm to only use a fixed size.

```
with client.batch.dynamic() as batch:
  ...
```

is equivalent to:

```
client.batch.configure_fixed_size()
with client.batch as batch:
  ...
```

`client.batch.rate_limit() as batch` is a new way to help avoid hitting third-party vectorization API rate limits. By specifying `request_per_minute` in the `rate_limit()` method, you can force the batching algorithm to send objects to Weaviate at the speed your third-party API is capable of processing objects.

These methods now return completely localized context managers. This means that `failed_objects` and `failed_references` of one batch won't be included in any subsequent calls.

Finally, if the background thread responsible for sending the batches raises an exception this is now re-raised in the main thread rather than silently erroring.

##### Filters [​](#filters "Direct link to Filters")

The argument `prop` in `Filter.by_property` has been renamed to `name`

Ref counting is now achievable using `Filter.by_ref_count(ref)` rather than `Filter([ref])`

#### Changes in `v4.4b8` [​](#changes-in-v44b8 "Direct link to changes-in-v44b8")

##### Reference filters [​](#reference-filters "Direct link to Reference filters")

Reference filters have a simplified syntax. The new syntax looks like this:

```
Filter.by_ref("ref").by_property("target_property")
```

#### Changes in `v4.4b7` [​](#changes-in-v44b7 "Direct link to changes-in-v44b7")

##### Library imports [​](#library-imports "Direct link to Library imports")

Importing directly from `weaviate` is deprecated. Use `import weaviate.classes as wvc` instead.

##### Close client connections [​](#close-client-connections "Direct link to Close client connections")

Starting in v4.4b7, you have to explicitly close your client connections. There are two ways to close client connections.

Use `client.close()` to explicitly close your client connections.

```
import weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

print(client.is_ready())

client.close()
```

Use a context manager to close client connections for you.

```
import weaviate

with weaviate.connect_to_local() as client:
     print(client.is_ready())

# Python closes the client when you leave the 'with' block
```

##### Batch processing [​](#batch-processing-1 "Direct link to Batch processing")

The v4.4b7 client introduces changes to `client.batch` .

* `client.batch` requires a context manager.
* Manual mode is removed, you cannot send batches with `.create_objects` .
* Batch size and the number of concurrent requests are dynamically assigned. Use `batch.configure_fixed_size` to specify values.
* The `add_reference` method is updated.
* The `to_object_collection` method is removed.

Updated `client.batch` parameters

| Old value | Value in v4.4b7 |
| --- | --- |
| from\_object\_uuid: UUID | from\_uuid: UUID |
| from\_object\_collection: str | from\_collection: str |
| from\_property\_name: str | from\_property: str |
| to\_object\_uuid: UUID | to: Union[WeaviateReference, List[UUID]] |
| to\_object\_collection: Optional[str] = None |  |
| tenant: Optional[str] = None | tenant: Optional[str] = None |

##### Filter syntax [​](#filter-syntax "Direct link to Filter syntax")

Filter syntax is updated in v4.4b7.

**NOTE** : The [filter reference syntax](#reference-filters) is simplified in 4.4b8.

| Old syntax | New syntax in v4.4b7 |
| --- | --- |
| Filter(path=property) | Filter.by\_property(property) |
| Filter(path=["ref", "target\_class", "target\_property"]) | Filter.by\_ref().link\_on("ref").by\_property("target\_property") |
| FilterMetadata.ByXX | Filter.by\_id()   Filter.by\_creation\_time()   Filter.by\_update\_time() |

The pre-4.4b7 filter syntax is deprecated. The new, v4.4b7 syntax looks like this.

```
import weaviate
import datetime
import weaviate.classes as wvc

client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

jeopardy = client.collections.use("JeopardyQuestion")
response = jeopardy.query.fetch_objects(
    filters=wvc.query.Filter.by_property("round").equal("Double Jeopardy!") &
            wvc.query.Filter.by_creation_time().greater_or_equal(datetime.datetime(2005, 1, 1)) |
            wvc.query.Filter.by_creation_time().greater_or_equal(datetime.datetime(2000, 12, 31)),
            limit=3
    )

client.close()
```

##### `reference_add_many` updated [​](#reference_add_many-updated "Direct link to reference_add_many-updated")

The `reference_add_many` syntax is updated; `DataReferenceOneToMany` is now `DataReference` .

```
collection.data.reference_add_many(
    [
        DataReference(
            from_property="ref",
            from_uuid=uuid_from,
            to_uuid=*one or a list of UUIDs*,
        )
    ]
)
```

##### References [​](#references "Direct link to References")

Multi-target references updated. These are the new functions:

* `ReferenceProperty.MultiTarget`
* `DataReference.MultiTarget`
* `QueryReference.MultiTarget`

Use `ReferenceToMulti` for multi-target references.

#### Older client changes [​](#older-client-changes "Direct link to Older client changes")

##### References [​](#references-1 "Direct link to References")

* References are now added through a `references` parameter during collection creation, object insertion and queries.
* The `FromReference` class is now called `QueryReference` .

##### Reorganization of classes/parameters [​](#reorganization-of-classesparameters "Direct link to Reorganization of classes/parameters")

* `weaviate.classes` submodule further split into:
  + `weaviate.classes.config`
  + `weaviate.classes.data`
  + `weaviate.classes.query`
  + `weaviate.classes.generic`
* `vector_index_config` parameter factory functions for `wvc.config.Configure` and `wvc.config.Reconfigure` have changed to, e.g.:

  ```
  client.collections.create(
      name="MyCollection",
      vector_index_config=wvc.config.Configure.VectorIndex.hnsw(
          distance_metric=wvc.config.VectorDistances.COSINE,
          vector_cache_max_objects=1000000,
          quantizer=wvc.config.Configure.VectorIndex.Quantizer.pq()
      ),
  )
  ```

  + `vector_index_type` parameter has been removed.
* `vectorize_class_name` parameter in the `Property` constructor method is `vectorize_collection_name` .
* `[collection].data.update()` / `.replace()` \*args order changed, aiming to accommodate not providing properties when updating.
* `[collection].data.reference_add` / `.reference_delete` / `.reference_replace` the `ref` keyword was renamed to `to` .
* `collections.create()` / `get()` : `data_model` kwarg to keyword to provide generics was renamed to `data_model_properties` .
* `[object].metadata.uuid` is now `[object].uuid` .
* `[object].metadata.creation_time_unix` is now `[object].metadata.creation_time` .
* `[object].metadata.last_update_time_unix` is now `[object].metadata.last_update` .
* `quantitizer` is renamed to `quantizer`
* To request the vector in the returned data, use the `include_vector` parameter.

##### Data types [​](#data-types "Direct link to Data types")

* Time metadata (for creation and last updated time) now returns a `datetime` object, and the parameters are renamed to `creation_time` and `last_update_time` under `MetadataQuery` .
  + `metadata.creation_time.timestamp() * 1000` will return the same value as before.
* `query.fetch_object_by_id()` now uses gRPC under the hood (rather than REST), and returns objects in the same format as other queries.
* `UUID` and `DATE` properties are returned as typed objects.
